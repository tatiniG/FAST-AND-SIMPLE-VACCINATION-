# FAST-AND-SIMPLE-VACCINATION-
This paper solely focuses on to generate a smooth vaccination process in countries like India  having a huge population and creating awareness among each and every person is required.  

Hence a heuristic approach is preferred to find a nearest optimal solution within reasonable 
running time. Graph coloring and shortest path are one of such heuristic algorithm that can deal 
to find optimal way to solve this problem.

Here criteria is to find eligible people of different ages and taking the constraint of vaccines
availability our project helps to accelerate vaccine delivery to the people (in efficient way) with 
low transportation cost.

This paper will be presenting a proposed of vaccinating and booking slots for the people all 
over the India by launching an website for better health services and faster aid through 
integrating two types of technology: Shortest path Algorithm and Slot booking System.

The application goal is to serve as a health aid application that will give instruction to avoid the 
covid-19 virus and provide the required information and help the infected to find the right place 
or apply for receiving request by using an online database system for adding and viewing lists 
of hospitals to get vaccinated in a very less time
